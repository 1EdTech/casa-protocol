# CASA Protocol

The [Community App Sharing Architecture (CASA)](http://imsglobal.github.io/casa) provides a mechanism for
discovering and sharing metadata about web resources such as websites, mobile
apps and LTI tools. It models real-world decision-making through extensible
attributes, filter and transform operations, flexible peering relationships,
etc.

The CASA Protocol defines a set of conformance modules for communication APIs
and data formats that enable the architecture. [Click here](http://imsglobal.github.io/casa-protocol) to view an
