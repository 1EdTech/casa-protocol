# USE (URI Sharing Environment) Protocol

The USE (URI Sharing Environment) Protocol provides a mechanism by which organizations may propagate and share information about URIs (such as web applications) throughout a network of peers in an automated fashion with support for heterogeneous and asymmetric peering and trust models.

See [protocol](https://github.com/uShare/protocol/blob/master/protocol.md) for more details.
