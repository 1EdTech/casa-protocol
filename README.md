# CASA Protocol

The [Community App Sharing Architecture (CASA)](http://imsglobal.github.io/casa) provides a mechanism for
discovering and sharing metadata about web resources such as websites, mobile
apps and LTI tools. It models real-world decision-making through extensible
attributes, filter and transform operations, flexible peering relationships,
etc.

The CASA Protocol defines a set of conformance modules for communication APIs
and data formats that enable the architecture. [Click here](http://imsglobal.github.io/casa-protocol) to view an
online version of the protocol.

## Status

The CASA Protocol Specification is in a 1.0.0-beta release. The basic structure of the protocol is complete, but changes
(especially the addition of attributes) are expected. Please check the change log (CHANGELOG.md). Please also let us know
if you are hosting a CASA peer.
