# CASA Protocol

The Community App Sharing Architecture (CASA) provides a mechanism by which 
organizations may share and propagate information about URIs (most commonly web 
applications) throughout a network of peers in an automated fashion with 
support for heterogeneous and asymmetric peering and trust models.

CASA is defined as:

* A CASA Engine responsible for sharing and discovering apps.
* The CASA Protocol that defines the communication format of the engine.
* CASA Outlets that expose applications known by the engine to end users.

The CASA Protocol defined herein (see 
[protocol.md](https://github.com/AppSharing/casa-protocol/blob/master/protocol.md)) 
specifies the communication APIs that must be exposed to be fully conformant 
with the Community App Sharing Architecture.
