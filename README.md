# CASA Protocol

The Community App Sharing Architecture (CASA) provides a mechanism by which 
organizations may share and propagate information about URIs (most commonly web 
applications) throughout a network of peers in an automated fashion with 
support for heterogeneous and asymmetric peering and trust models.

In a set of Protocol Modules and Attribute Specifications, the CASA Protocol 
defines the communication APIs and data formats that enable the architecture.
