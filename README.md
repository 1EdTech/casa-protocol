# CASA Protocol

The [Community App Sharing Architecture (CASA)](http://imsglobal.github.io/casa) provides a mechanism for
discovering and sharing metadata about web resources such as websites, mobile
apps and LTI tools. It models real-world decision-making through extensible
attributes, filter and transform operations, flexible peering relationships,
etc.

The CASA Protocol defines a set of conformance modules for communication APIs
and data formats that enable the architecture. [Click here](http://imsglobal.github.io/casa-protocol) to view an
online version of the protocol.

## Status

The CASA Protocol Specification is in a 1.0.0-beta.1 release. The basic structure of the protocol is complete, but changes
(especially regarding Attributes) are expected. Please check the change log in this directory `CHANGELOG.md`.

If you are hosting a CASA peer and you would like to connect with other peers, please get in touch. We are working towards creating
CASA specification conformance guidelines and tests as well as a web-based registry of CASA instances.
